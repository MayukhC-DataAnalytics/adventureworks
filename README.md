In the Project, I have taken guidance from instructors of Microsoft Press and they have provided the Data set used in this entire project.
The dataset were fully scattered and in various extensions(formats), so I have taken the help of Power Query editor of Power BI to use it as ETL tool to extract data from various resources and transform (Clean) the data.

Created Dimension tables 1. Customer Table  2. Product Table 3. Sales Territory 4. Data Table using DAX
